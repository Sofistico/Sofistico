### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a small practioner of the art of thaumaturgy, otherwise know as coding.<br/>

Working as a .Net Developer.<br/>

I learned how to program in 2019 due to corona and finally having some free time in my job, so i took to learn C# and fell in love with this world of software and programming.<br/>

if i had a say in what i want to learn more, it would be everything! In special: C#, C++, C, JavaScript, Python, HTML and CSS.<br/>

My current focus is in C# and C++.<br/>

I was studying physics in college, but due to having fallen in love with coding, changed to Software Enginnering and let's see how it will go.

Languages i know: C#(My main focus and love!), C++, JavaScript, Python and Rust.<br/>
Have dabbled in CSS, R and Ruby.<br/>
I know Asp.Net, Angular, Razor and some react.
Have worked with MVC, Microservices, Windows Services, Windows Sockets(Never again) and docker.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I live in Brazil.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ (This time for real).
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m always working on my hobby project MagiRogue.
