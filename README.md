### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a small practioner of the art of thaumaturgy, otherwise know as coding.<br/>

Working as a Junior Asp.Net Dev currently.<br/>

I stared learning how to program in 2019 due to corona and having some free time in my job, so i took to learn C# and fell in love with this world of software and programming.<br/>

I want to learn more about everything, specially C#, C++, C, JavaScript, Python, HTML and CSS.<br/>

I was studying physics in college, but due to a new found love of programming, changed to Softawere Enginner and let's still see how it will go.

Currently i know C#, HTML, C++, JavaScript, Python and Rust.<br/>
Have dabbled in CSS, R and Ruby.<br/>
Know some Asp.Net, Angular and Razor.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I live in Brazil.
