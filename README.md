### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a small dev working in QA currently, know how to do automated tests in Selenium C# and a little bit of C#.
Have just began learning how to program in this year due to corona and having free time, want to learn more about everything, specially C#, C++, C, JavaScript, Python, HTML and CSS.
I am currently studying physics in college, but due to a new found love of programming, might change courses but let's see how it goes.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I live in Brazil.
