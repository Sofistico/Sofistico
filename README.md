### Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am an aspiring practitioner of the enchanting art of thaumaturgy, better known as coding. As a dedicated .NET Developer, I constantly strive to master the realm of software and programming.<br/>

My journey into the world of programming began in 2019 during the unprecedented times of the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilizing the newfound spare time in my job, I delved into learning C#, which captured my heart and ignited a passion for this captivating domain.<br/>

If I were to choose, I would eagerly explore a plethora of programming languages, including C#, C++, C, JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS. However, at present, my primary focuses lie within the realms of C# and C++.<br/>

Previously pursuid studies in physics at college, but i couldn't resist the allure of coding and subsequently transitioned to Software Engineering. I am now eagerly anticipating the exciting prospects that lie ahead in this field.<br/>

Here are some of the stacks i'm acquainted with: </br>
C# (my main love and focus!), C++, JavaScript, Python, and Rust. </br>
I have also dabbled in CSS, R, and Ruby. </br>
In addition, I possess knowledge in Asp.Net, Angular, Razor, and some React. </br>
Throughout my professional experience, I have worked with MVC, Microservices, Windows Services, Windows Sockets (although I'd prefer not to revisit that), and Docker. </br>

- ðŸŒ± Currently, I am wholeheartedly immersing myself in the world of C++ to further expand my skill set.
- ðŸ”­ My ongoing passion project is MagiRogue, which I continuously refine and enhance.
