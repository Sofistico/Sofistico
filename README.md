### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a small dev working in QA currently, but i'm trying to get a more development focused job.
I stared learning how to program in 2019 due to corona and having some free time in my job, so i took to learn C# and fell in love with this world of software and programming.
I want to learn more about everything, specially C#, C++, C, JavaScript, Python, HTML and CSS.
I am currently studying physics in college, but due to a new found love of programming, might change to Softawere Enginner but let's see how it goes.

Currently i have workable skill C#, HTML, C++, JavaScript and Python.
Have dabbled in CSS, Rust, R and Ruby.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I live in Brazil.
